Unboxing the NVIDIA Xavier NX

Got hold of a Xavier NX from SEEED, flew over from SZ to SG in 7 days.
Here's what this IOT super-charged "PI" can do.  It's simply amazing.  I complied codes and do concurrent tasks and the system is stable.
I can also toggle the use of CORES and wattage.  More importantly, got to download a few stuff. such as jtop.

# First Impression

Hunt for jTop and install to see the various stuff running.  It's like top except tailored for NVIDIA

Not going to write alot, but here's some videos that I captured to show the power of this device
Deepstream 5 is not pre packaged with the intial load.  You can just go hunt and do some git clone and compliation.

Once, you get the compliation right, you can run the various kinds of application from the samples
